# LearningJS Introduction

This is a repository where I learn how to code Javascript and start my journey
into web development.

Setup server:
* change directory to project directory and run http_server in cmd (npm)
* change directory to my_collection and run 'p5 server' or 'p5 s' (p5-manager)

Go to *http://localhost:8080* or *http://localhost:5555*, depending on choice of server, in chrome and open console (Ctrl + Shift + I)

Refresh (Make sure that in "Network" in the console that Caching disabled is checked)

To create a new project open windows terminal, change directory to "my_collection". Then generate a new project via 'p5 generate PROJECT_NAME' or 'p5 g PROJECT_NAME'

## Projects

This section contains the different p5 projects that I have made while following the lectures on "The Coding Train" on YouTube. Not all videos have its own project as some of them are more elementary than others.
